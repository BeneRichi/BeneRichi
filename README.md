### Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frontend Developer with expertise in Vue.js, Laravel, React, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, SCSS and HTML5.

My skills in Vue.js allow me to create reactive and efficient user interfaces, making sure the best user experience for your web application.

I use Laravel as a PHP framework to create robust and scalable backends for my web applications, coupled with the power of Eloquent for easy database management.

I am currently using React.js as it is the primary framework for the fork of the Reef Web App that I am working on privately. My goal is to contribute my changes and improvements to the original team's project.

I am also familiar in Javascript and familiar with familiar libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue.js

Tailwind CSS is my preferred choice for styling my web application, allowing me to quickly prototype and build responsive designs.

SCSS is my preferred preprocessor for writing clean and maintainable CSS.

HTML5 is the backbone of my web development skills and I make sure to use semantic and accessible markup for all of my projects.

A new fan of ESlint which I use to keep my code clean and consistent, it helps me to follow best practices and prevent potential errors by linting my code and highlighting any issues before I run or deploy it.

Feel free to take a look at my projects and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
